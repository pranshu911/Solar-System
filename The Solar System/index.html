        The Sun is our nearest star. The Sun provides us with light and heat.
        Without the Sun there would be no daylight, and our planet would simply
        be a dark, frozen world, with no oceans of liquid water and no life.
        This huge ball of superhot gas is 1.4 million kilometres across, equal
        to 109 Earths set side by side. With a mass of 2
        million-trillion-trillion-trillion kilograms, it weighs as much as
        330000 Earths. About 1 300 000 Earths would fit inside the Sun! From
        Earth, the Sun looks like it moves across the sky in the daytime and
        appears to disappear at night. This is because the Earth is spinning
        towards the east. The Earth spins about its axis, an imaginary line that
        runs through the middle of the Earth between the North and South poles.
        This means that to us here on the spinning Earth, the Sun appears to
        rise in the east in the morning, and climb higher and higher in the sky
        towards midday. In the afternoon the Sun then seems to move lower and
        lower in the sky before setting in the west. Although it seems small
        when seen at sunrise or sunset, this is only because the Sun lies about
        150 million km away from us. At this distance, it takes about 8 minutes
        for sunlight to reach us – even when it is travelling at about 300 000
        km/s. This means that we see the Sun set eight minutes after the event
        has actually taken place!

        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun. It is not very easy to observe
        since it is always close to the Sun in the sky. Even when best placed,
        it is close to the horizon and only visible for a few hours after sunset
        or before sunrise. Named after the winged messenger of the gods, the
        planet speeds around the Sun once every 88 days. However, it spins on
        its axis very slowly – once every 58.6 days. This is exactly two thirds
        of its orbital period. Mercury is a small, rocky world. It is only about
        as wide as the Atlantic Ocean and 18 Mercurys could fit inside the
        Earth. Mercury is very like the Moon. Its surface is covered with impact
        craters. It has no atmosphere and no water. The noon temperature at the
        equator can soar to 450°C but the nights are extremely cold, below
        -180°C. There may be some water ice in the deep, dark craters near the
        poles. Mercury is surprisingly dense. It is thought to have a large iron
        core that fills most of Mercury’s interior. It also has a surprisingly
        strong magnetic field. So far, less than half of the surface has been
        imaged at close range by the Mariner 10 spacecraft. ESA and Japan are
        planning to send two orbiter spacecraft to Mercury in 2013. The
        BepiColombo mission is named after a famous Italian mathematician and
        scientist.

    <div id="venus_c" class="content">
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, so it is always fairly close to
        the Sun in the sky. It appears as a brilliant morning or evening “star”
        – the brightest object in the night sky apart from the Moon. In a
        telescope, it can be seen to go through phases, just like the Moon.
        Venus is so bright because it is covered by clouds that reflect much of
        the incoming sunlight. The yellowish clouds are made of sulphur and
        sulphuric acid. In some ways, Venus is Earth’s twin. It is about the
        same size and made of the same rocky materials. It also comes closer to
        us than any other planet. However, it is blanketed with a thick
        atmosphere of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide traps most of the heat
        from the Sun. The cloud layers also act as a blanket. The result is a
        “runaway greenhouse effect” that has caused the planet’s temperature to
        soar to 465°C, hot enough to melt lead. This means that Venus is even
        hotter than Mercury. Without special protection, a visitor to Venus
        would die instantly – crushed by the immense air pressure, suffocated by
        the atmosphere, burned to a crisp by the scorching heat, and dissolved
        by the acid. The surface of Venus has been mapped by radar. The maps
        show thousands of volcanoes and impact craters. There are two main
        upland areas, with a mountain range taller than Mt. Everest. Dozens of
        spacecraft have visited Venus, but many mysteries remain. Most of its
        instruments have been studying the dense atmosphere and rapidly moving
        clouds, or investigating how the Sun affects the planet.

        Earth is the third planet from the Sun. Earth travels around the Sun at
        an average distance of about 93 million miles (150 million kilometres).
        It appears bright and bluish when seen from outer space. Earth is the
        only planet in the solar system that can support life. Life is possible
        on Earth because the planet has water on its surface and oxygen gas in
        its air. Earth also has the perfect range of temperatures for life. The
        average temperature on Earth is about 59° F (15° C). Earth is the fifth
        largest planet in the solar system. It is made up of three layers: the
        core, the mantle, and the crust. Like all planets, Earth has two types
        of motion: orbit and spin. Its orbit is the path it takes around the
        Sun. It takes Earth 365.25 days to go around the Sun once. This is equal
        to one calendar year. The force that keeps Earth orbiting the Sun is
        called gravity. Scientists believe that Earth is about 4.6 billion years
        old. Earth’s surface has changed greatly since it was first formed. Some
        changes have taken place over millions of years as wind and water have
        eroded, or worn away, the land. Erosion has created features such as the
        Grand Canyon. Other changes have happened very quickly. The force of an
        erupting volcano or an earthquake can change the surrounding land in
        just hours

    <div id="moon" class="box"><h2>Earth's Moon</h2></div>
    <div id="moon_c" class="content">
    <p>
      Earth has just one moon – a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming from the Sun. From Earth, it might look like the Moon is changing shape each night – from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What’s actually happening is that from our spot on Earth, we see different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side." Scientists believe that the Moon formed early in the solar system’s history after Earth and an object about the size of Mars smashed into each other. The impact sent chunks of Earth and the impactor into space that were pulled together by gravity, creating the Moon. Today, we know that the Moon is covered by craters as well as dust and debris from comets, asteroids and meteoroid impacts. There are still many questions left to answer about the Moon. And the most exciting days of lunar activity may still lie ahead as NASA sends humans on the next missions to the Moon.

    <div id="mars" class="box"><h2>Mars</h2></div>
    <div id="mars_c" class="content">
      <p>
        Mars is often called the 'Red Planet' because it appears in the sky as
        an orange-red star. The colour caused the ancient Greeks and Romans to
        name it after their god of war. Today, thanks to visiting spacecraft, we
        know that the planet's appearance is due to rust in the Martian rocks.
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It orbits the Sun at an average
        distance of 228 million km, half as far again as the Earth, so human
        visitors would find it very cold. Although summers near the equator can
        be quite warm, the average temperature is 63 degrees Celsius below zero
        - similar to winters in Antarctica. The nights are also bitterly cold.
        The first humans on Mars will have other problems to face. The air is
        100 times thinner than on Earth, and mostly made up of carbon dioxide.
        Human explorers will have to wear oxygen masks and special suits every
        time they step outside their sealed homes. Violent storms can whip up
        clouds of dust. Sometimes these spread rapidly around the entire planet,
        hiding the surface from view.

    <div id="jupiter_c" class="content">

        Beyond the asteroid belt is Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun.
        Everything about Jupiter is large. It is so big that it could easily
        swallow all of the other planets (or more than 1,300 Earths). It also
        weighs more than twice as much as all the other planets. Despite its
        huge size, Jupiter is the fastest-spinning planet, rotating once in less
        than 10 hours. Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun as the Earth,
        so its surface temperature is low, around –145°C. Every 13 months or so
        it comes closer to us and becomes very bright in the night sky. Jupiter
        is a giant ball of gas, with no solid surface. It is mainly made of the
        very light gases, hydrogen and helium. Telescopes show a cloudy
        atmosphere with colourful belts and spots. The largest feature – called
        the Great Red Spot – is a giant storm, several times the size of the
        Earth. It has been blowing non-stop for more than 300 years. Jupiter has
        a faint ring of dust, over 100,000 km wide, that was discovered by the
        Voyager spacecraft. It is also orbited by the largest family of
        satellites (63 at the latest count). Four of these, discovered by the
        Italian scientist Galileo in 1610, are very big. It has hundreds of
        volcanoes that cover its surface with yellow-orange sulphur.

    <div id="saturn" class="box"><h2>Saturn</h2></div>
    <div id="saturn_c" class="content">
      <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. It was thought to be the
        furthest of the planets until the telescope was invented. Second only in
        size to Jupiter, Saturn is made mainly of the light gases hydrogen and
        helium. 764 Earths would fit inside Saturn, but the gas giant weighs
        only 95 times as much as our rocky world. If you could put all of the
        planets in a pool of water, Saturn is the only one that would float.
        Despite its size, Saturn spins once in a little more than 10 hours. Its
        spin is so rapid that it bulges outwards at the equator, making it look
        like a ball that has been squashed. In a telescope, Saturn appears a
        pale yellow colour. It has no solid surface, so what we are seeing are
        clouds that appear as light and dark bands. These clouds are blown along
        by very strong winds. Much of the heat that drives these winds comes
        from inside the planet. Above the cloud tops is a flat, disk-shaped
        system of rings. Much of what we know about Saturn has come from the
        NASA-ESA Cassini-Huygens mission. The Cassini orbiter has been in orbit
        around the planet since 1 July 2004. It has been exploring many of
        Saturn’s moons, especially planet-sized Titan. It has also sent back
        remarkably detailed pictures and other data about Saturn’s
        thunderstorms, the thousands of icy ringlets and the magnetic field.

    <div id="uranus" class="box"><h2>Uranus</h2></div>
    <div id="uranus_c" class="content">
      <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It was discovered by William
        Herschel in 1781. Uranus lies more than 2,800 million km from the Sun.
        At this distance, the temperature of its cloud tops is -214 degrees C.
        It moves quite slowly and has a long way to travel, so each orbit lasts
        84 years. Uranus is a giant world, the third largest planet in our Solar
        System. 64 Earths would fit inside it. Despite its size, it spins
        rapidly. A day on Uranus lasts only 17 hours 14 minutes. Uranus spins
        like a top knocked over on its side. This means that the Sun is
        sometimes directly overhead at the poles. Each pole has a summer and a
        winter lasting 21 years, making them the hottest and coldest places on
        the planet! When the Voyager 2 spacecraft visited Uranus in 1986, hardly
        any clouds were visible. However, recent images by the Hubble Space
        Telescope have shown some very large storms. The main gases in its thick
        atmosphere are hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane. (The
        methane scatters blue light, which is why Uranus appears blue). However,
        it is very different from Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus is mainly made of
        ‘ices’ – a mixture of water, methane and ammonia. At its centre there
        may be a small rocky core. This means that it is very lightweight for
        its size. Uranus has 27 known moons. None of these are very big. Uranus
        also has at least a dozen dark, dusty rings. Most of these are extremely
        thin. They are kept in shape by nearby “shepherd” moons.

    <div id="neptune" class="box"><h2>Neptune</h2></div>
    <div id="neptune_c" class="content">
      <p>
        Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Johann Galle, an astronomer at the
        Berlin Observatory. Galle knew where to look because of calculations by
        French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier. Both Le Verrier and John Adams
        in England had realised that an unseen planet was pulling on Uranus,
        causing it to slow down or speed up. Neptune turned out to be almost an
        identical twin of Uranus. It is 57 times bigger than the Earth, but
        spins quite rapidly – one day lasts only 16 hours 7 minutes. Its average
        distance from the Sun is about 4,500 million km, and one year on Neptune
        lasts for almost 165 Earth years. Like Uranus, it has an atmosphere of
        hydrogen, helium and methane. Its interior is made of ices, with a
        possible rocky core. Although the atmosphere is very cold (-220 degrees
        C), the blue planet has some very strong winds and violent storms.
        Voyager 2 imaged a huge spot the size of the Earth. Neptune has at least
        five dark, narrow rings (named after Galle, Le Verrier, Adams and others
        who worked to discover the planet). It has 13 known moons. By far the
        largest is Triton, an icy world that is bigger than Pluto. Triton is
        very cold, so its thin atmosphere has frozen onto the surface. It seems
        to have been captured by Neptune’s gravity long ago.

    <div id="pluto" class="box"><h2>Pluto</h2></div>
    <div id="pluto_c" class="content">
      <p>
        Pluto was discovered in 1930 by 24 year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who was
        using a special machine to compare photos of the sky. It turned out to
        be a tiny world, even smaller than our Moon. Pluto follows an elliptical
        (egg-shaped) orbit that varies between 7,381 million km (49 Sun-Earth
        distances) and 4,446 million km (30 Sun-Earth distances). Since one
        orbit lasts 248 years, no one born on Pluto would ever experience a
        single birthday! Very little is known about Pluto. Its surface is
        extremely cold (-230 degrees C) and seems to be covered with frozen
        ices. In recent years it has been fairly close to the Sun and enjoying a
        brief summer. Surface ices have vaporised, producing a thin atmosphere.
        However, it is now retreating into the cold depths of the Solar System
        and this atmosphere will soon freeze again. Pluto spins “backwards”
        (east to west) once every 6 days 9 hours. Its largest moon, Charon,
        takes the same length of time to orbit Pluto. This means that anyone
        living on one side of Pluto would never see Charon. Two smaller moons
        have recently been discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. For many
        years, Pluto was accepted as the ninth planet from the Sun (even though
        it sometimes comes closer than Neptune). Today, it is regarded as a “
        dwarf planet”. It is also one of the largest members of the Kuiper Belt,
        a family of icy worlds that occupy the space beyond Neptune.
